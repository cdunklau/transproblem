i've isolated my translation problem... strings passed from the view directly
to a response will not show up translated. this is clear because they don't get
localized. but colander errors and field name should be translated, right?


Steps to set up:

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Run commands:
    virtualenv -p python3.4 venv
    venv/bin/python setup.py develop
    venv/bin/pserver development.ini
3.  Open http://localhost:6543/?_LOCALE_=de
4.  Observe that the labels for the two fields are translated ("Wert" instead
    of "Value"), but nothing else is.

Clearly the "Register for our mailing list" won't get translated because that
comes directly from the view into the HTML... but the "Email Address" was
provided to colander as the schema node's title, and I expect that to get
translated. Also, the "Register" button should be translated, since I gave
that to the form in a button.

What gives?
    
Updated:

The TranslationStringFactory's domain was set to 'transproblem', but the .mo
files were called 'tutorial'. Changing the domain to 'tutorial' resolved the
issue.
